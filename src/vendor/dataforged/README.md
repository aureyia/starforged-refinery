## What's this all about, anyways?

_Ironsworn: Starforged_ is a tabletop role-playing game that's playable in solo, co-op (GM-less), and guided (GMed) modes.

> In _Ironsworn: Starforged_, you are a spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

For more information on _Ironsworn: Starforged_ itself, check out [the website](https://getstarforged.com/).

The Dataforged repo exists to provide the Creative Commons-licensed text and image content of _Ironsworn: Starforged_, so that you--an intrepid developer with excellent taste in indie TTRPGs--don't need to do data entry for the game's 200+ oracle tables, 90 asset cards, 56 moves, and 14 setting truth categories, and 24 example encounters.

Use it as source material to build a personal reference wiki, a play aid, a discord bot, or module for your favourite VTT, or something that nobody else has imagined yet. [Be sure to check out some of the projects that use Dataforged below](#projects-that-use-dataforged).

Dataforged may be useful to you even if you aren't developing something for _Ironsworn: Starforged_ specifically: the overwhelming majority of its d% oracle tables are system agnostic, so they might be used for any generator or other TTRPG tool with a sci-fi/space opera flavour.

Now, go forth and make something cool! 🚀 And be sure to tell us about it on the [_Ironsworn_ Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/6QMvmJb) and the [_Ironsworn_ subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ironsworn/) so we can see what you've done with the data!

## Usage

Consult the [API Documentation for further information](https://rsek.github.io/dataforged).

### NodeJS

If you're working in Javascript or Typescript, Dataforged is best consumed as a NodeJS package:

```bash
npm i dataforged
```

```bash
yarn add dataforged
```

Typescript typings are included; use of VSCode or an IDE to expose the type annotations in your workspace is highly recommended. See also the [API documentation site](https://rsek.github.io/dataforged).

If you just want the data as-is, import the `starforged` object to use the pre-loaded, typed JSON.

#### ESM

```javascript
import { starforged } from '@/vendor/dataforged';
```

#### CommonJS

```javascript
const { starforged } = require('@/vendor/dataforged');
```

### Other Languages

Packages for other languages/package managers are a work in progress. For now, you can use the JSON files in [`dist/starforged`](dist/starforged). `dataforged.json` contains all game data in a single object; `schema.json` describes its JSON schema.
